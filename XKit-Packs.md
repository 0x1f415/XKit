With XKit Packs, you can publish your extensions without getting them added to the XKit Extension Gallery or inspected by The XKit Guy.

### Advantages
1. No waiting for XKit Guy to inspect/add your extension.
2. No asking users to use XKit Editor.
3. Extensions are stored on XKit servers, and updated when you update them.

### Disadvantages
1. Your extension will not be listed on XKit Extension Gallery, you have to promote them yourself.
2. Your extension can't have several blacklisted words, including eval, document and script, even on comments.
3. Huge, scary warning message when installing XKit Packs.

## Get Started
1. Go to [XCloud WebAccess](http://xkit.info/xcloud/webaccess/) page.
2. Click on Create XKit Pack.
3. Open [the XKit Editor](http://www.tumblr.com/xkit_editor)
4. Create a new extension
