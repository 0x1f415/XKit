With XKit Packs, you can publish your extensions without getting them added to the XKit Extension Gallery or inspected by The XKit Guy.

### Advantages
1. No waiting for XKit Guy to inspect/add your extension.
2. No asking users to use XKit Editor.
3. Extensions are stored on XKit servers, and updated when you update them.

### Disadvantages
1. Your extension will not be listed on XKit Extension Gallery, you have to promote them yourself.
2. Your extension can't have several blacklisted words, including eval, document and script, even on comments.
3. Huge, scary warning message when installing XKit Packs.

## Quick Start
1. Go to [XCloud WebAccess](http://xkit.info/xcloud/webaccess/) page.
2. Click on Create XKit Pack.
3. Open [the XKit Editor](http://www.tumblr.com/xkit_editor)
4. Create a new extension    
5. After you are done writing your extension, go back to XCloud WebAccess page.
6. Click on My Packs
7. Select your pack, and paste your Script and CSS code, and include a 64x64/PNG icon.

## Very Important Warnings

#### Extension Name
Your extension name **must** match the ID you gave to your pack, and you **must** prepend your XCloud ID to it while creating the extension using XKit Editor.  

For example, if your XCloud ID is **mrkittens** and you've ID'd your pack with **textextension**, the filename of the extension on XKit Editor **must** be **mrkittens_testextension**.
