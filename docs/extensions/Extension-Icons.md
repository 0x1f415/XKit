# Extension Icons

Your extension's icon is very important.  A badly drawn icon, or an icon that doesn't really fix the rest of the icons used by XKit extensions will turn off your users, and will lead them to think the extension is amateurish, and might be buggy. A good branding is important for a good extension.

### Technical

* XKit extension icons are 32x32 pixels.
* While displaying the icon, XKit rounds the corners of your icon and adds a subtle shadow to it.

### Style

* XKit icons are simple: they use one or two symbols on the icon.
* They are not realistic: they use symbols, and not real/realistic photos.

### Colours

* Most extensions that work on dashboard, and add features to it have the same background colour of the dashboard as their background, and white on top of that.
* Use light colours, especially on the background of your icon. Do not use black or a really dark color as the background color.
* Use contrasting colours. Do not use, for example, light grey on top of a darker grey, it will be practically invisible when viewed on a laptop in a bright location.

### Lightning

* On XKit icons, lightning comes from top-left corner, and should be subtle.

### Symbols

* Don't go all abstract, use clear imagery.
* Try to use as few symbols on your icon as possible.
* Most XKit icons use [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/) for their symbols.
* The symbols should be at least ~4 px away from the corners of the icon.
