###Â Things you need
1. XKit 6.9 or higher, with all the internal extensions up to date.
2. Javascript and jQuery knowledge.
3. Patience and enough hair to pull when Tumblr changes something and breaks your extension.
	* XKit users (well, actually, all the computer users) like their extensions updated when Tumblr changes something and breaks them. If you are going to get bored with your extension after a few days and not provide any updates to it, it's better to keep the extension to yourself.

### Get started
1. Open the XKit Control Panel > Other > XKit Editor
	or go to www.tumblr.com/xkit_editor
2. Click on **New Extension** 
3. Give a name to your extension (eg: my_extension) 
4. Update the **"[Legacy Headers](https://github.com/atesh/XKit/wiki/Legacy-Headers)"**:
	* If "FRAME" is set to true, it will only work on Tumblr blog iframe
	* Add "SLOW" if your extension manipulates the page extensively.
	* Change "DEVELOPER" to your github username (eg: atesh). 
	* Add "DETAILS" to write a long description about your extension
5. Start writing!
